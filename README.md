<h2>Scientific solutions to emerging problems</h2>
<h2> Environmental Effects and Public Health </h2>


==============================

<p>
    In this entry for the CdeCMX Challenge, which pursues different coding challenges in different areas of expertise, we developed ways of analyzing Covid-19 data through Tweets and cases per municipality in Mexico. The following are our visualizations and results.
